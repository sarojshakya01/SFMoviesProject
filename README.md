Project: SF Movies

Problem Statement: Create a service that shows on a map where movies have been filmed in San Francisco. User should be able to filter the view using autocompletion search.

The movie filming locations data are avalable on [DataSF : Film Locations](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am)
